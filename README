I feel the design of GUI libraries today is too complex.
Things like GTK+, QT, and all of their evil friends use the same, bloated design.
This repo shows that it doesn't have to be that way, the code in here is a reference implementation of the very core of a GUI library.
The design of my GUI library has a buffer, which can be contained by a master frame or a sub-frame.
These frames have callbacks and those callbacks have parameters, both of which are stored in the frame.
These callbacks will modify the frame. 
So a button could have the callbacks of a background, border, text, and maybe a button callback.
The reference implementation may have some bugs or not work.
Its main purpose is for other people to make GUI libraries based off of this implementation.
